# LinkedListDates
The date database program allows the option of uploading a txt file with dates 
already written out, manually entering the desired dates, or randomly creating and
entering as many dates as desired. The dates are entered into database and connected
using a linked list. Once the dates are in the database, there are options of deleting,
adding, modifying, or searching through the stored dates.
